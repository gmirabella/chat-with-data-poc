            The dataset is ALREADY loaded into a DataFrame named 'df'. DO NOT load the data again.
            
            The DataFrame has the following columns: {column_names}
            
            Before plotting, ensure the data is ready:
            1. Check if columns that are supposed to be numeric are recognized as such. If not, attempt to convert them.
            2. Handle NaN values by filling with mean or median.
